Please note: running "make install" will overwrite the insteon and x10toinst
shell scripts as well.  If you have customized earlier versions of them,
make sure that you have a backup.  You have been warned.

To install, run the following:

	make install

Be sure to create /etc/plmtools.conf with the line:

PLMTTY	"/dev/ttyXXX"

where "/dev/ttyXXX" is the TTY device your PLM is attached to.

If you plan to use plmcat, plmsend, and plmtty directly rather than through
the included shell scripts, you may want to set TTYLINENAME in plm.h to the
PLM TTY device.  However, PLMTTY in plmtools.conf will override this in the 
included shell scripts only.  If you want to hardcode TTYLINENAME into
plmcat, plmsend, and plmtty as well as use the included shell scripts, you
must set the device filename in both plm.h and plmtools.conf.  This 
requirement will change when I decide that I care enough to fix it.

See insteon.conf.example, x10toinst.conf.example and plmtools.conf.example.
